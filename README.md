# TEXT_EMOTION_CLASSIFICATION

# Emotion Detection from Text

This project predicts emotions from textual input using multiple machine learning models. It handles the complete ML pipeline: data preprocessing, class balancing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and inference.

## üß† Model Overview

The following models were trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- HistGradientBoostingClassifier (Scikit-learn)
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

Class imbalance is handled using **SMOTE**. Feature extraction is done with **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
